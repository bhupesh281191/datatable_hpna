Here’s a side-by-side comparison of the Excel filter logic vs the Python script logic, with the key differences highlighted.

#	Filter / Rule	Excel (Screenshot-1)	Python Script (Screenshot-2)	Difference
1	Product Tier-1 = NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE	Yes – explicitly listed	Not shown	❌ Missing in code (or handled earlier, not visible here)
2	Status = Deployed	Yes	Not shown	❌ Missing in code
3	Product Tier-3 (Routers, Switch, LB, etc.)	Yes – explicit list	Not shown	❌ Missing in code
4	Mark as Deleted != 1	Yes	Not shown	❌ Missing in code
5	Exclude Manufacturers	CLOUDGENIX, WESTERN TELEMATIC, SYMANTEC, NOVIFLOW, BROCADE, QLOGIC, VIDYO, BLADE NETWORK TECHNOLOGIES INC	Includes ALL Excel names PLUS GIGAMON, NETSCOUT SYSTEMS, ARBOR NETWORKS, SKYBOX SECURITY, TIPPINGPOINT	✅ Code excludes more manufacturers than Excel
6	Exclude Products (VC & ONS modules)	1/10Gb-F VC Ethernet Module Cisco ONS MSTP VC 4Gb FC Module VC Flex-10/10D VC FlexFabric-20/40	Same list present	✅ Matches
7	Exclude Serial containing “_STACK”	Yes	Yes	✅ Matches
8	Exclude AVI Load Balancers where CI_NAME contains “-”	Yes	Present but appears commented / disabled	⚠ Possible mismatch
9	Exclude Juniper EX4200, M120	Yes	Yes	✅ Matches
10	Exclude records older than 2 months (LAST_SCAN_DATE)	Yes	Not shown	❌ Missing in code
11	Exclude NULL Serial Numbers	Yes	Not explicitly shown	⚠ Possibly missing
12	Deduplicate Serial Numbers (keep first)	Yes	Yes	✅ Matches
13	Exclude SYSTEM_ENV = Development / UAT	Yes	Yes	✅ Matches
14	Exclude PRODUCT starting with “NEXUS 2”	Yes	Yes – explicitly handled	✅ Matches
15	Export duplicates for review	Not mentioned	Yes – code writes CSV report	➕ Extra step in code


⸻

🔍 Summary (Simple)
	•	✅ Most device-level exclusions match
	•	➕ Code has more manufacturers excluded
	•	⚠ AVI filter might be disabled in code
	•	❌ These Excel filters are NOT visible in code:
	•	Product Tier1 filter
	•	Status filter
	•	Product Tier3 filter
	•	Mark as Deleted != 1
	•	Last Scan Date > 2 months
	•	NULL Serial Number removal

If you want, I can also:

✔ rewrite the Python to match Excel 1-to-1
✔ or produce a clean checklist for validation

Great — here’s an updated Jira comment that clearly references what Jayesh asked in the mail:

Jira Comment:

Validated all three items requested by Jayesh:
• Compared GTZ SevOne filter logic vs auto-seeding logic
• Checked whether System Environment + Contingency are included in auto-seeding
• Compared GTZ HPNA logic with the latest known HPNA auto-seed logic

I have completed the analysis for all three and am preparing a detailed document with findings. Will revert back over email shortly.

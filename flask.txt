Great — here’s an updated Jira comment that clearly references what Jayesh asked in the mail:

Jira Comment:

Validated all three items requested by Jayesh:
• Compared GTZ SevOne filter logic vs auto-seeding logic
• Checked whether System Environment + Contingency are included in auto-seeding
• Compared GTZ HPNA logic with the latest known HPNA auto-seed logic

I have completed the analysis for all three and am preparing a detailed document with findings. Will revert back over email shortly

Hi Darren,

Thank you for the update. I understand the concern regarding the consolidated report.
Sarthak is currently on leave until 2nd January, and I am continuing to work on validating the defect and the related data issues in the meantime.

To ensure full clarity and alignment, may we please connect over a short Teams meeting at your convenience? This will help us review the gaps and agree on the corrective steps.

Thank you for your patience and support.

Best regards,
Bhupesh
